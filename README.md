# Traffic_Optimization_Using_QAOA
This project utilizes quantum-classical hybrid algorithms, primarily QAOA, to optimize traffic congestion and green-light timings via quantum circuits. It lays the foundation for large-scale traffic optimization with potential for additional constraints or machine learning integration. Currently, it functions solely as a data optimization tool.
